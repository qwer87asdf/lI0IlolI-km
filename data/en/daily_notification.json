She may marry whomever she wishes following the laws of Shariah, and none of the deceased man’s heirs has any right to impose anything upon her. The second part of the verse states that if a man does not wish to live with his wife, he must not coerce her into seeking <em>khul‘</em> (divorce initiated by the wife) to reclaim the mahr he had given her. In other words, he&#039;s not maintaining a regular marital life with his wife, but he&#039;s also not granting her a divorce, hoping instead that she will seek <em>khul‘</em> so he can recover the mahr or be excused from paying what he owes.

However, if any part of the body becomes exposed unintentionally during work or needs to be uncovered due to a specific necessity, there is no sin in that. Regarding this, it is stated: “Except what [ordinarily] appears thereof.” Ibn Jarir al-Tabari (rahimahullah) mentioned in his Tafsir that Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (RA) said this exception refers to the outer garment (jilbab or burqa) itself, which women use to cover their bodies, as it is not possible to conceal that garment itself. (Meaning: women must not expose their bodies or jewelry in front of non-mahram men, but the garment they use to cover themselves can be visible to men.) Abdullah ibn Abbas (RA) explained that if, out of necessity, the face or hands need to be uncovered, this verse permits it. However, since the face is the focal point of beauty, it must ordinarily remain covered, as also commanded in Surah Al-Ahzab (33:59). Yes, in cases of necessity, uncovering the face is allowed, but at that time, men are instructed to lower their gaze.</p>"

The gist of the reply is that this world is essentially a place of trial. The test is whether a person uses their intellect and judgment, and based on the clear signs scattered throughout the universe, comes to believe in the oneness of Allah (Tawheed) and the messengership of the Prophets. For this reason, true value in this test lies in belief in the unseen (Ghayb). If Allah were to be seen directly, where would the test be? It is a principle of Allah that if a person sees the unseen things with their own eyes, their belief is no longer acceptable. That is why the unseen things are not made visible. However, when this world is brought to an end and the time for punishment and reward arrives, some of the unseen things will be shown with the naked eye. The phrase &quot;the matter is decided&quot; in the verse refers to this.<br>Source : Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p>"

And Allah said to them, &quot;Die.&quot; Then He brought them back to life. Indeed, Allah is a possessor of bounty for the people, but most people do not show gratitude.</p><p class=\"reference\">Surah: Al-Baqarah Ayah: 243</p><h4>Footnote :</h4><p>From this point to verse 260, two topics are discussed. The main objective is to encourage jihad. However, since the hypocrites and cowardly people were very afraid of death, they were hesitant to go to war, which is why the second topic is also discussed. The summary of this topic is that life and death are in the hands of Allah alone. He can cause death even without war and can protect a person&#039;s life even in the middle of a fierce battle. Moreover, He has the power to bring a person back to life after death. While this power will be fully manifested in the Hereafter, He has also shown the world some examples where dead people have been brought back to life. One such example is shown in this verse (243).</p><p>Furthermore, in verse 253, it is hinted that Allah gave life to several dead people through Prophet Isa (Jesus). Similarly, verse 258 describes the conversation between Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and Nimrud, showing that the matter of life and death is completely in Allah&#039;s hands. The fourth event is described in verse 259, which recounts the story of Prophet Uzair. Then, the fifth event is mentioned in verse 260, where Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) requested Allah to show him how He brings the dead back to life.</p><p>The event described in the current verse (No. 243) is not detailed in the Quran. It is only mentioned that at one point in time, a community left their homes in thousands to escape death. But Allah still caused their death. Then, He brought them back to life to show that if a person disobeys Allah&#039;s command and uses some trick to escape death, there is no guarantee that they will succeed. No matter what strategy they adopt, Allah can still make them taste death.</p><p>Who were these people? What was the time period? What was the reason they were fleeing from death? These details are not mentioned in the Quran. They are not mentioned because the Quran is not a history book. The purpose of the events narrated in it is only to provide a lesson. Therefore, only the parts of the events that provide that lesson are narrated. The part of this event that has been described provides the lesson mentioned above.</p><p>However, the manner in which the Quran refers to the event suggests that it was famous and well-known among people at that time. The verse begins with the phrase, &quot;Do you not know their situation?&quot; This indicates that the event was well-known. Therefore, Hafiz Ibn Jarir Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) has cited several narrations from Abdullah ibn Abbas and some of the Tabi&#039;een, which suggest that this was an event of the Children of Israel. Despite being thousands in number, they did not have the courage to face the enemy. Instead, they fled their homes in fear of death. Alternatively, they fled the area for fear of being afflicted with the plague. As soon as they reached the place they considered safe, they died by the command of Allah. Much later, when their bones had decayed, Prophet Hizqeel (Ezekiel) passed by that place. Allah commanded him to call out to the bones. As soon as he called out, life was breathed into the bones, and they came back to life in complete human form. This event of Prophet Hizqeel is also mentioned in the current Bible (see Ezekiel 37:1-15). Thus, it is not impossible that this event was spread in Medina through the Jews.</p><p>Whether the above details of the event are reliable or not, it is clear and straightforward from the Quranic verse that they were truly brought back to life after being dead. Some modern writers, who consider the resurrection of the dead to be illogical, have interpreted this verse to mean that &#039;death&#039; refers to political and moral death, and &#039;bringing to life&#039; means political victory. However, this interpretation does not align with the clear wording of the Quran, nor is it consistent with the Arabic literary style and Quranic narrative. The simple fact is that if one has faith in the immense power of Allah, there is nothing to be astonished about in such events. So, why the need for such far-fetched interpretations? Especially in the context of the series of discussions from this verse to verse 260, the summary of which has been given before, the literal meaning of death and life is more logical here.<br>Source : Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p>"

It should not be for showing off to people or for gaining worldly returns. If a loan is given for jihad or to help the poor, there should be no demand for interest.</p><p>The disbelievers used to take out interest-bearing loans for their military needs. Muslims have been warned that, first, they should give donations rather than loans. If they must give a loan, they should not demand more than the principal amount. Even though they will not receive interest in this world, Allah will give them a reward in the Hereafter that will be many times greater than the principal.</p><p>Regarding the fear that such spending might diminish one&#039;s wealth, Allah says that both scarcity and abundance are in His hands.

The first chapter in the Bible in the name of Prophet Samuel (peace be upon him) states that for several days, he kept challenging the Children of Israel, &quot;Who is there to fight me?&quot; But no one had the courage to face him in combat.</p><p>Prophet David (peace be upon him) was a young man at the time. His three brothers were participating in the war. Being the youngest, he stayed behind to serve his elderly father. After a few days of war, his father sent him to the battlefield to check on his brothers. Upon reaching the field, he saw that Goliath was continuously issuing challenges, and no one was stepping forward to fight him. This sight stirred his pride. He asked King Saul (Talut) for permission to go to the battlefield to fight Goliath. At first, Saul and others were hesitant due to his young age. Finally, after his insistence, he was granted permission. He went before Goliath, invoked the name of Allah, and threw a stone that struck him directly on the forehead. The stone went through his head, and he immediately fell to the ground. Then, David (peace be upon him) went to him and decapitated him with his own sword (1 Samuel, Chapter 17).</p><p>Up to this point, there is no conflict between the Bible&#039;s and the Quran&#039;s accounts. However, after this, the Bible says that Saul (or Ma&#039;ul) became envious of Prophet David&#039;s popularity. In this context, the Bible narrates various unbelievable stories about him. It is very likely that this was propaganda from the faction of the Children of Israel who were opposed to Saul from the beginning. The way the Quran praises Saul, it is unlikely that he would harbor a disease like jealousy and malice.</p><p>In any case, because of his feat of killing Goliath, Prophet David gained such popularity that he later became the king of the Children of Israel. Additionally, Allah also honored him with the rank of prophethood. He was the first person in whom both prophethood and kingship were combined.<br>Source : Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p><p></p>"

But whoever returns [to dealing in interest] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.</p><p class=\"reference\">Surah: Al-Baqarah, Ayah: 275</p><h4>Footnote :</h4><p>An extra amount of money charged on any loan is called &#039;riba&#039; or interest. The polytheists used to say, &quot;Just as we earn a profit from selling a product and the Sharia has made that lawful, what is the problem with earning a profit from giving a loan?&quot;</p><p>The answer to their question was this: The purpose of a product is to earn a profit by selling it. On the other hand, money was not created to be a commodity for earning a profit. Money is a medium of exchange. It was created with the purpose of facilitating the buying and selling of necessary goods. If currency is exchanged for currency and made a means of earning profit, various harms and evils arise from it. (For more details on this, one can refer to the judgment I wrote on &#039;riba&#039; in the Pakistan Supreme Court. Its Urdu translation has also been published under the title &#039;Sud Par Tarikhi Faisla&#039; - &#039;A Historic Verdict on Interest&#039;).</p><p>However, in this instance, instead of explaining the difference between trade and interest, Allah the Almighty gave a sovereign-like response. It was stated that when Allah has made trade lawful and interest unlawful, it is not the job of a servant to question its meaning and philosophy, or to show an attitude of not obeying the command until they understand it.</p><p>The reality is that every command of Allah undoubtedly contains some wisdom, but it is not necessary that this wisdom will be understood by everyone. Therefore, if one has faith in Allah, they should first accept His command. After that, if someone tries to understand the wisdom and mystery for additional peace of mind, there is no harm in it. The fault lies in postponing the implementation of the command until the wisdom is understood, which cannot be the approach of a believer.<br>Source: Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p>"

That is because they said, &quot;Trade is only like interest.&quot; But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden interest. So whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists - for him is what was in the past, and his affair is left to Allah. But whoever returns [to dealing in interest] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.</p><p class=\"reference\">Surah: Al-Baqarah, Ayah: 275</p><h4>Footnote :</h4><p>An extra amount of money charged on any loan is called &#039;riba&#039; or interest. The polytheists used to say, &quot;Just as we earn a profit from selling a product and the Sharia has made that lawful, what is the problem with earning a profit from giving a loan?&quot;</p><p>The answer to their question was this: The purpose of a product is to earn a profit by selling it. On the other hand, money was not created to be a commodity for earning a profit. Money is a medium of exchange. It was created with the purpose of facilitating the buying and selling of necessary goods. If currency is exchanged for currency and made a means of earning profit, various harms and evils arise from it. (For more details on this, one can refer to the judgment I wrote on &#039;riba&#039; in the Pakistan Supreme Court. Its Urdu translation has also been published under the title &#039;Sud Par Tarikhi Faisla&#039; - &#039;A Historic Verdict on Interest&#039;).</p><p>However, in this instance, instead of explaining the difference between trade and interest, Allah the Almighty gave a sovereign-like response. It was stated that when Allah has made trade lawful and interest unlawful, it is not the job of a servant to question its meaning and philosophy, or to show an attitude of not obeying the command until they understand it.</p><p>The reality is that every command of Allah undoubtedly contains some wisdom, but it is not necessary that this wisdom will be understood by everyone. Therefore, if one has faith in Allah, they should first accept His command. After that, if someone tries to understand the wisdom and mystery for additional peace of mind, there is no harm in it. The fault lies in postponing the implementation of the command until the wisdom is understood, which cannot be the approach of a believer.<br>Source: Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p>"

When the time came to perform &#039;Umrah the next year, some companions were apprehensive, thinking, &quot;What if the polytheists of Makkah break the treaty and start a war with us? If something like that happens, the Muslims will be in a difficult situation. How can they fight within the sacred precincts and especially in the month of Dhu al-Qadah? After all, fighting is not permissible in this month.&quot;</p><p>This verse provided the guidance that the Muslims should not initiate the war themselves. However, if the disbelievers break the treaty and start a war on their own, then it is permissible for the Muslims to fight. If they disregard the sanctity of the sacred precincts and the holy month and launch an attack, it will be permissible for the Muslims to retaliate against their transgression.<br>Source: Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p>"

Unfortunately, Nafl and Mustahab acts are often neglected because people believe there is no sin in omitting them. This mindset focuses on the negative aspect—the lack of punishment—rather than the positive aspect of earning great rewards.</p><p><strong>A Grave Mistake</strong></p><p>A more significant error is the belief that teaching others about these Nafl acts and proper etiquette (adab) is also an optional, or Nafl, duty. As a result, people may not take this responsibility seriously, and some even view those who do as being overly strict.</p><p><strong>A Collective Obligation</strong></p><p>According to Islamic law, this idea is incorrect. The duty to teach, practice, and promote matters of Nafl and adab is a Fard Kifayah—a collective obligation.

It is a highly recommended Sunnah to perform this two-rak&#039;ah prayer whenever one enters a mosque, except in specific situations.</p><p>You can still pray these two rak&#039;ahs even if there isn&#039;t enough time to perform the full four-rak&#039;ah Sunnahs. The pre-prayer Sunnahs for &#039;Asr and &#039;Isha are flexible; they can be prayed as either two or four rak&#039;ahs. Therefore, it is a significant mistake to sit down and miss out on the opportunity to perform a valid prayer simply because you can&#039;t complete the full four units.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, April 2009 <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

The purity of the garments is separate from the spiritual state.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What to Do in an Emergency</strong></p><p>If a pilgrim accidentally leaves their Ihram garments in their luggage and cannot access them before crossing the Miqat (the boundary for entering Ihram), they don&#039;t need to panic. The correct procedure is to make the intention and recite the Talbiyah while still in their regular clothes.

This is incorrect. The Islamic legal rulings (fiqh) state that a quiet recitation requires a person to move their tongue and lips to pronounce the words correctly, even if they are only audible to themselves. A Hadith confirms this, mentioning that the companions of the Prophet (PBUH) could tell he was reciting quietly during the Zuhr and Asr prayers by the movement of his beard. Therefore, reciting the Quran only in the mind is not a valid recitation.</p><h4>Reciting the Takbirat al-Ihram Silently</h4><p>Another common mistake is to recite the opening Takbir, &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; (God is the Greatest), silently. This is often seen in congregational prayers where a person may only raise their hands. However, the Takbirat al-Ihram is a fard (obligatory) component of the prayer that must be pronounced out loud, even if only the person themselves can hear it. Merely raising the hands is not enough. If a person does not audibly pronounce the Takbir, their prayer is not valid. The three necessary steps for beginning a prayer are:</p><p><strong>Intention:</strong> Making the intention in your heart.</p><p>Takbirat al-Ihram: Clearly pronouncing &quot;Allahu Akbar.&quot;</p><p><strong>Raising and Folding Hands:</strong> Raising the hands and placing them below the navel, which is a Sunnah (prophetic practice).</p><p>Saying &quot;Ameen&quot; Silently (in mind)</p><p>It is also a mistake to recite &quot;Ameen&quot; in one&#039;s mind after the Imam finishes reciting Surah al-Fatihah. While it is to be said quietly or in a low voice, this does not mean silently. Saying it quietly means pronouncing it audibly to oneself, even if others can&#039;t hear. Saying &quot;Ameen&quot; is a highly virtuous Sunnah, and to receive its reward, it must be properly spoken with the tongue.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The author concludes by emphasizing that all verbal parts of the prayer, including the recitation, Takbirs, praises, and supplications, must be pronounced with the tongue, not just thought in the mind.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, January 2011, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

This is completely false. Tawba is not a sign of impending death; rather, it is an essential and constant practice for a believer. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself used to repent 70 to 100 times daily. Repentance is an act of seeking forgiveness for past sins and making a firm resolve to not repeat them. The door of repentance is open until death, and a believer should repent as often as possible.</p><p><strong>Sneeze or Choke? Someone Is Thinking of You!</strong></p><p>The belief that someone is thinking of you when you sneeze or choke on food is a completely baseless superstition. There is no religious or logical connection between these physical actions and someone remembering you.</p><p><strong>A Fabricated Story: Allah Desired Human Flesh</strong></p><p>The text condemns a vile and completely fabricated story attributed to a speaker about Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani (RA). The story claims that Allah once desired human flesh and asked Prophet Musa (PBUH) to bring it, but only Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani (RA) was willing to offer a piece of his own body. This story is an outrageous lie and a grave offense against the fundamental beliefs of Islam. It is utterly incompatible with the divine nature of Allah and should be immediately rejected with the words, &quot;Subhanaka, hadha buhtanun &#039;adheem&quot; (Glory be to You, this is a grave slander).</p><p><strong>&quot;When the Righteous Are Mentioned, Mercy Descends&quot; - Not a Hadith</strong></p><p>Many people quote the saying, &quot;When the righteous are mentioned, mercy descends,&quot; as a Hadith. However, this is incorrect. This statement is not a saying of the Prophet (PBUH) but rather a quote from the well-known scholar Sufyan ibn &#039;Uyaynah (RA). While the meaning is sound and based on experience, it should not be attributed to the Prophet (PBUH).

The author states that this is also a mistaken belief.</p><p>The Correct Practice: This is not a Sunnah.

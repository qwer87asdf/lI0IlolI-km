She may marry whomever she wishes following the laws of Shariah, and none of the deceased man’s heirs has any right to impose anything upon her. The second part of the verse states that if a man does not wish to live with his wife, he must not coerce her into seeking <em>khul‘</em> (divorce initiated by the wife) to reclaim the mahr he had given her. In other words, he&#039;s not maintaining a regular marital life with his wife, but he&#039;s also not granting her a divorce, hoping instead that she will seek <em>khul‘</em> so he can recover the mahr or be excused from paying what he owes.

However, if any part of the body becomes exposed unintentionally during work or needs to be uncovered due to a specific necessity, there is no sin in that. Regarding this, it is stated: “Except what [ordinarily] appears thereof.” Ibn Jarir al-Tabari (rahimahullah) mentioned in his Tafsir that Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (RA) said this exception refers to the outer garment (jilbab or burqa) itself, which women use to cover their bodies, as it is not possible to conceal that garment itself. (Meaning: women must not expose their bodies or jewelry in front of non-mahram men, but the garment they use to cover themselves can be visible to men.) Abdullah ibn Abbas (RA) explained that if, out of necessity, the face or hands need to be uncovered, this verse permits it. However, since the face is the focal point of beauty, it must ordinarily remain covered, as also commanded in Surah Al-Ahzab (33:59). Yes, in cases of necessity, uncovering the face is allowed, but at that time, men are instructed to lower their gaze.</p>"

The test is whether a person uses their intellect and judgment, and based on the clear signs scattered throughout the universe, comes to believe in the oneness of Allah (Tawheed) and the messengership of the Prophets. For this reason, true value in this test lies in belief in the unseen (Ghayb). If Allah were to be seen directly, where would the test be? It is a principle of Allah that if a person sees the unseen things with their own eyes, their belief is no longer acceptable. That is why the unseen things are not made visible. However, when this world is brought to an end and the time for punishment and reward arrives, some of the unseen things will be shown with the naked eye. The phrase &quot;the matter is decided&quot; in the verse refers to this.<br>Source : Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p>"

His claim, &quot;I give life and cause death,&quot; meant that because he was king, he could take the life of anyone he wished and could pardon and release those who deserved the death penalty, thus &quot;giving them life.&quot;</p><p>It&#039;s clear that his response was not at all consistent. However, Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw that Nimrod either didn&#039;t understand what the creation of life and death meant, or he was deliberately engaging in a sophistical argument.</p><p>Eventually, Prophet Ibrahim said something for which Nimrod had no answer. But instead of accepting the truth when he was silenced, he first had Prophet Ibrahim arrested and then ordered him to be thrown into a fire, as described in Surah Al-Anbiya (21:68-71), Surah Al-Ankabut (29:24), and Surah As-Saffat (37:97).<br>Source: Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p>"

The Muslims have been advised at the end not to engage in futile arguments, but rather to strive to practice their religion as much as possible. As such, a discussion about various Islamic beliefs and regulations is now beginning.</p><p>The discussion starts by emphasizing patience, as this was a time when the Muslims were facing various obstacles from their enemies in following and spreading their religion. They were engaged in wars against their enemies, which caused them numerous hardships. Many times, relatives and friends had to embrace martyrdom, or there was a possibility of it happening in the future.</p><p>Therefore, the Muslims are advised that such trials are inevitable on the path of truth. The duty of a believer is to be content with the will of Allah the Almighty and to show patience and steadfastness. It should be noted that crying in times of distress is not against patience, as shedding tears from pain is a part of human nature. Therefore, the Sharia has not forbidden it. Unintentional crying is also not a lack of patience.</p><p>Patience means that despite the pain and sorrow, one does not complain to Allah; instead, one remains intellectually content with Allah&#039;s decree. An example can be given with an operation. When a doctor performs an operation, the person feels pain. Many times, they may even scream unintentionally, but they have no complaint against the doctor for performing the operation. This is because they believe that whatever the doctor is doing is out of sympathy and for their benefit.<br>Source: Tafsir-e-Tawzeehul Quran</p>"

They had created different social classes according to their own ideas, and if a person of a lower class killed someone of a higher class, the heirs of the deceased would seek to kill someone from the killer&#039;s tribe who was equal in status to the deceased, instead of the killer himself.

However, since the meanings of these duas are generally good, it is not impermissible to recite them simply as a general form of remembrance of Allah, as long as you do not believe they are part of the Prophet&#039;s practice.</p><h4>The Correct Approach</h4><p>It is crucial to remember that these are not authentic duas of wudu. True Sunnah prayers and supplications are well-known and can be found in established Hadith collections. Focusing on what is authentically reported is the correct approach to Islamic practice.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, August-2007, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

This should be done correctly, with the following conditions:</p><p>The food must be bought with halal earnings.</p><p>It must come from one&#039;s own wealth, not from inherited property that has not yet been distributed.</p><p>It should not be performed on specific, customary days like the 3rd, 10th, or 40th day after death, as this practice has no basis in the Sunnah.</p><p>There should be no reciprocal arrangement where food is given in exchange for religious rituals.</p><p>It&#039;s always best for each individual to perform acts of charity, such as giving money or food, praying nawafil (supererogatory prayers), or making sincere dua for the forgiveness and salvation of the deceased.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, October 2008, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

The grave sins of kufr (disbelief) and shirk (polytheism) emerged later, largely through the creation of images and statues. According to a Sahih Hadith, early people would make portraits and statues of their righteous predecessors. Initially, this was done for remembrance and honor, but over time, it led to veneration, bowing, prostration, and eventually, outright worship. This gradually led to people associating partners with Allah and becoming polytheists.</p><p><strong>Why the Practice is Forbidden in Islam</strong></p><p>Islam strictly prohibits practices that can lead to polytheism.</p><ul><li><p>Creating images or statues is considered a major sin.</p></li><li><p>Offering wreaths and flowers at these statues or portraits is seen as a highly objectionable act that is against the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah.</p></li><li><p>Such acts not only risk leading people toward shirk but also dishonor the legacies of the deceased, as they contradict the very faith they might have lived by.</p></li></ul><p>The author concludes by saying that a true Muslim should honor their deceased loved ones and historical figures through methods prescribed by Islamic law, such as praying for their forgiveness and remembering their good deeds.

        "data": "<p class=\"sanad\">Common Mistakes in Prayer</p><p>The text highlights several common mistakes people make while praying (salat), particularly concerning vocalizing parts of the prayer.</p><h4>Reciting the Quran Silently (in mind)</h4><p>Many people who pray quietly believe that reciting the Quran slowly means doing so entirely in their mind without moving their mouth or lips. This is incorrect. The Islamic legal rulings (fiqh) state that a quiet recitation requires a person to move their tongue and lips to pronounce the words correctly, even if they are only audible to themselves. A Hadith confirms this, mentioning that the companions of the Prophet (PBUH) could tell he was reciting quietly during the Zuhr and Asr prayers by the movement of his beard. Therefore, reciting the Quran only in the mind is not a valid recitation.</p><h4>Reciting the Takbirat al-Ihram Silently</h4><p>Another common mistake is to recite the opening Takbir, &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; (God is the Greatest), silently. This is often seen in congregational prayers where a person may only raise their hands. However, the Takbirat al-Ihram is a fard (obligatory) component of the prayer that must be pronounced out loud, even if only the person themselves can hear it. Merely raising the hands is not enough. If a person does not audibly pronounce the Takbir, their prayer is not valid. The three necessary steps for beginning a prayer are:</p><p><strong>Intention:</strong> Making the intention in your heart.</p><p>Takbirat al-Ihram: Clearly pronouncing &quot;Allahu Akbar.&quot;</p><p><strong>Raising and Folding Hands:</strong> Raising the hands and placing them below the navel, which is a Sunnah (prophetic practice).</p><p>Saying &quot;Ameen&quot; Silently (in mind)</p><p>It is also a mistake to recite &quot;Ameen&quot; in one&#039;s mind after the Imam finishes reciting Surah al-Fatihah. While it is to be said quietly or in a low voice, this does not mean silently. Saying it quietly means pronouncing it audibly to oneself, even if others can&#039;t hear. Saying &quot;Ameen&quot; is a highly virtuous Sunnah, and to receive its reward, it must be properly spoken with the tongue.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The author concludes by emphasizing that all verbal parts of the prayer, including the recitation, Takbirs, praises, and supplications, must be pronounced with the tongue, not just thought in the mind.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, January 2011, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

This is completely false. Tawba is not a sign of impending death; rather, it is an essential and constant practice for a believer. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself used to repent 70 to 100 times daily. Repentance is an act of seeking forgiveness for past sins and making a firm resolve to not repeat them. The door of repentance is open until death, and a believer should repent as often as possible.</p><p><strong>Sneeze or Choke? Someone Is Thinking of You!</strong></p><p>The belief that someone is thinking of you when you sneeze or choke on food is a completely baseless superstition. There is no religious or logical connection between these physical actions and someone remembering you.</p><p><strong>A Fabricated Story: Allah Desired Human Flesh</strong></p><p>The text condemns a vile and completely fabricated story attributed to a speaker about Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani (RA). The story claims that Allah once desired human flesh and asked Prophet Musa (PBUH) to bring it, but only Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani (RA) was willing to offer a piece of his own body. This story is an outrageous lie and a grave offense against the fundamental beliefs of Islam. It is utterly incompatible with the divine nature of Allah and should be immediately rejected with the words, &quot;Subhanaka, hadha buhtanun &#039;adheem&quot; (Glory be to You, this is a grave slander).</p><p><strong>&quot;When the Righteous Are Mentioned, Mercy Descends&quot; - Not a Hadith</strong></p><p>Many people quote the saying, &quot;When the righteous are mentioned, mercy descends,&quot; as a Hadith. However, this is incorrect. This statement is not a saying of the Prophet (PBUH) but rather a quote from the well-known scholar Sufyan ibn &#039;Uyaynah (RA). While the meaning is sound and based on experience, it should not be attributed to the Prophet (PBUH). It is important to distinguish between the sayings of scholars and the words of the Prophet (PBUH).</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, February 2011, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

This is a widespread but incorrect idea. The author clarifies that wudu&#039; is only required if someone wishes to perform the Salat al-Tawba (Prayer of Repentance). Otherwise, a person can repent at any time and in any state, without needing to perform wudu&#039;.</p><p>The article outlines several other common mistakes:</p><p>Repentance causes death: This is a baseless superstition. The purpose of repentance is to seek a new life free from sin, not to hasten death.</p><p>Repentance must be performed by a religious figure: This is also incorrect. Repentance is a personal act between a person and Allah. One must sincerely regret their sins, stop committing them, and resolve not to repeat them in the future.</p><p>The Correct Method of Repentance</p><p>The text explains the proper way to perform Tawba:</p><p>For sins against Allah&#039;s rights: One must stop the sin, feel remorse, resolve not to repeat it, and make up for any missed obligatory acts (like prayers).</p><p>For sins against people&#039;s rights: One must also return the rights they have violated or seek forgiveness from the person they wronged, in addition to the above steps.</p><p>The author concludes by emphasizing that Tawba is a continuous act for a believer. The Prophet (PBUH) used to seek forgiveness dozens of times a day, which proves that repentance is an ongoing practice, not a one-time event reserved for certain conditions.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, June 2011, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

The author also points out that the processions (jashne julūs) and other baseless acts performed during these celebrations further compound the error.</p></li><li><p><strong>Focus on Deeds and Piety:</strong> The author reminds readers that Allah accepts sincere deeds (amal) and taqwa (piety), not external showmanship. Only following the Sunnah is acceptable to Allah, not bid&#039;ah.</p></li><li><p><strong>Following Foreign Customs:</strong> The author questions whether a practice adopted from a culture, such as that of Christians (whose ways Muslims pray to be guided away from in Surah al-Fatihah), can truly benefit the Muslim community.</p></li></ul><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, March 2012, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

Therefore, the reality of istikhara is to perform two rak&#039;ahs (units) of nafl (voluntary) prayer and then recite the du&#039;a taught in the Hadith regarding a matter one intends to do (after careful consideration and consultation). The essence of the du&#039;a is, &quot;O Allah! If this matter is good for me, then make it easy for me and grant me blessings in it. But if it is not suitable for me, then turn me away from it, lead me to where goodness lies, and grant me the ability to be content with it.&quot;</p><p>According to the authentic Hadith, this is the reality of istikhara. However, some people think that the istikhara prayer and du&#039;a must be performed before going to sleep. They also believe that the result of the istikhara—whether the task should be done or not—is conveyed through a dream. This is undoubtedly a baseless idea. One might see a dream after istikhara, but dreams can also be seen without it. If something is seen in a dream, it must be judged based on the rules of Shari&#039;ah concerning dreams. The course of action, in this case, must be determined according to the relevant Shari&#039;ah ruling. And everyone knows that dreams are not a source of evidence.</p><p>Another mistake related to istikhara is following the method mentioned in some unreliable books of du&#039;a and wazifa. However, there is no sense in adopting someone&#039;s experience or invention by abandoning the prescribed method of istikhara.</p><p>A newly invented and bid&#039;ah (innovative) method of istikhara is to seek a sign from the Quran, or from Diwan-e-Hafiz, Masnavi, etc. This is a completely wrong method. And seeking such a sign from the Holy Quran is essentially a sign of disrespect towards it.</p><p>Another mistake is having someone else perform istikhara for you. Many people request the mosque&#039;s Imam or a familiar aalim (scholar) to do istikhara for them. However, the Hadith says that the person in need should perform the istikhara themselves.</p><p>The most dangerous delusion is that some people go to un-Islamic soothsayers not only to decide on a matter but also to find out various hidden things, and they call this istikhara. They even believe what these people say. However, going to someone to know the unseen and believing their words is a form of shirk (associating partners with Allah).</p><p>May Allah protect us from all kinds of shirk. Amen.</p><p>(For more details, study: Al-Madkhal, Ibn al-Hajj 4/36-40; Hayatul Hayawan 3/38; Ithaf al-Sadat al-Muttaqin, Murtada Zabidi 2/285.

The new campus of Markazud Da&#039;wah Al-Islamiyah Dhaka is located in Hazratpur, Keraniganj. There, in some nearby mosques, a practice was observed where the mu&#039;adhdhin (caller to prayer) recites tasbih, du&#039;a, na&#039;t, or at least durud sharif (blessings upon the Prophet) over the microphone at the time of the adhan, and only then does he say the first takbir of the adhan. This is usually heard during the Maghrib adhan, and in some places, during the Fajr adhan as well.</p><p>This is a newly invented practice. It had no existence during the three best generations of Islam (Khayr al-Qurun), or even for several centuries after that. It is explicitly mentioned in Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaybah that the beginning of the adhan is the takbir: &quot;Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.&quot;</p><p>This is the method that has been followed since the time of the Prophet. The Hadith mentions three actions: responding to the adhan, reciting durud after the adhan, and then reciting a du&#039;a. These are personal actions. The mu&#039;adhdhin will also recite the durud and du&#039;a after the adhan, but privately and in a low voice—not loudly and not over the microphone.</p><p>Adopting this newly invented practice while abandoning the method of the Hadith and the continuously transmitted Sunnah is a mistake. It is a form of bid&#039;ah (innovation). The adhan is a symbol and sign of Islam. Any change or addition to a symbol or sign is a highly reprehensible act.</p><p>In some areas of the Barelwi community, it is seen that they start every adhan with durud sharif, using the words &quot;As-Salatu Was-Salamu Alaika Ya Rasulallah&quot; (Peace and blessings be upon you, O Messenger of Allah). This durud is permissible to recite during the visitation of the Prophet&#039;s tomb (Rawdah athar) but not for general situations. On the one hand, they have added durud sharif to the adhan on their own accord. On the other hand, they have added a durud that is not meant to be recited in all situations.</p><p>May Allah grant us the fortune of following the Prophet&#039;s Sunnah along with our love for him. If a newly invented method is preferred over the Sunnah and example of the beloved one, what kind of love is that?!</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al Kawsar, May 2012, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

        "data": "<p class=\"sanad\">Common Mistakes</p><h4>Some Mistakes Regarding Divorce</h4><p>In this issue, it seemed appropriate to discuss only this topic. It has been written many times, and scholars and religious leaders also discuss it, that just as it is not permissible for a husband to give a divorce without extreme necessity (which is considered a valid excuse in Shari&#039;ah), it is also not appropriate for a wife to ask for one. The path of divorce has been left open only for use in cases of extreme necessity. It is not necessary to explain how much turmoil, chaos, oppression, and conflict an incident of divorce causes in a family in modern society, especially in our region. Using the power of divorce outside the guidelines prescribed by Shari&#039;ah is undoubtedly an act of frivolity with the laws of Allah.</p><p>Therefore, anyone who tries to enter married life has an essential duty to learn the necessary rulings of married life, including the laws of divorce, before getting married.</p><p>Divorce is an extremely sensitive matter. If someone misuses this power or applies it in a wrong way, they will not only be a sinner, but the divorce will also take effect. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every sensible husband to carefully refrain from uttering the word &#039;divorce&#039; or any of its synonyms.</p><p>However, if one is compelled to give a divorce due to extreme necessity, one should give only a single divorce to the wife in a state of purity (when she is not menstruating). He should say, &quot;I divorce you.&quot; He should not use the word &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; (irrevocable) or the number &#039;3&#039; with the divorce. If someone says the word &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; (whether it&#039;s one or two divorces), the way to reunite with the wife will be closed without a new, Shari&#039;ah-compliant marriage.</p><p>Similarly, if three divorces are given—whether they are given separately in the same sitting or with a single word, for example, by saying, &quot;I give you three divorces,&quot; or if two divorces were given before and now only one divorce is given, making a total of three—if three divorces are given in any way, the marital relationship completely ends. In this situation, there is no opportunity to take the wife back merely by verbal means, nor is the path open to remarrying her.</p><p>Giving three divorces at once or giving divorces at different times until they total three is a heinous crime and a detestable act. As a punishment for this, Allah has legislated that if they wish to live together again as husband and wife, it is essential for the wife to complete her waiting period (iddah), marry another man, and have intimacy with him. Afterwards, if she is divorced for any reason or her husband dies, they can, after she completes her waiting period, re-enter into a marriage contract if they both agree.</p><p>For this reason, Shari&#039;ah has warned in advance: first, do not even think about divorce. However, if there is a need to give a divorce due to extreme necessity, give only a simple divorce—just one divorce. This allows both parties to have an opportunity to rethink and the path to returning remains open. If a problem arises again, give only one more divorce. The path to returning will still be open.</p><p>But if after this, another single divorce is given, and the total reaches three, then in this situation, there will be no opportunity to take her back, and the legality of a new marriage will also be gone.</p><p>Nowadays, instead of learning the laws of divorce and acting accordingly, husbands and wives hold so many wrong and fabricated rulings in their minds, may Allah forgive us.</p><p><strong>1. Does divorce not occur without three divorces?</strong></p><p>For example, some people think that giving only one or two divorces does not constitute a divorce. They consider it essential to give three divorces at once for a divorce to be effective.</p><p>Remember, this idea is completely wrong. The correct method of giving a divorce is to give only one divorce. If needed again later, give only one divorce. Do not give more than that. But if three divorces are given, all paths to maintaining their marital relationship will be closed.</p><p>Giving three divorces in the same sitting or with the same word is haram (forbidden) and a major sin. But if someone does this, the divorce will be effective, and their marital relationship will completely end.</p><p><strong>2. Is it necessary to use the word &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; with divorce?</strong></p><p>Many people think that divorce does not occur by just saying &#039;divorce&#039;; rather, it is essential to add the word &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; with it.</p><p>This is also a wrong idea. Divorce takes effect just by the word &#039;divorce.&#039; There is no need to add the word &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; to it. Furthermore, the addition of this word is impermissible. However, if someone gives one &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; divorce or two &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; divorces, they have closed the path of verbally taking the wife back. Now, only one path remains open, which is to perform a new, Shari&#039;ah-compliant marriage. In contrast, by just saying &#039;divorce,&#039; the path of verbal reconciliation remains open for up to two divorces. Therefore, a husband should, no matter how angry he is, never give three divorces. He should not even utter it. Yet, some people even add the word &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; after giving three divorces, as if giving all the divorces was not enough for them. Otherwise, what is left to say &#039;ba&#039;in&#039; after giving three divorces?!</p><p>Remember, giving three divorces is one sin, and by adding the word &#039;ba&#039;in,&#039; he becomes even more sinful.</p><p><strong>3. Does divorce not occur if three divorces are given at once?</strong></p><p>Some people have also spread the misconception that if three divorces are given at once, divorce does not occur or only one divorce occurs.</p><p>This is also a serious mistake. Even though giving three divorces at once is not permissible, if someone does this impermissible act, three divorces do indeed fall upon his wife. In this case, his right to verbally take her back is not preserved. They cannot even become halal for each other again by performing a new marriage. Therefore, it is the duty of all husbands to be extremely careful from the very beginning. Never utter the words &#039;three divorces&#039; or &#039;divorce, divorce, divorce.&#039; And if two divorces have already been given, do not even think about a third one now.</p><p><strong>4. Does divorce not take effect if given during pregnancy?</strong></p><p>Some people have fabricated this rule that if a wife is given a divorce while she is pregnant, it does not take effect. This is also a completely baseless statement. Whether the divorce is given during pregnancy or in any other condition, it takes effect. Therefore, it is everyone&#039;s responsibility to learn the correct rulings. A forbidden thing can never become permissible due to the deception of ignorance.</p><p><strong>5. Is the presence of witnesses necessary for a divorce to take effect?</strong></p><p>Some people think that if a husband does not have any witnesses at the time of divorce, the divorce does not take effect. Like the previous one, this is also a man-made ruling. It is unknown which ignorant person said this. The need for witnesses is at the time of marriage. For a divorce to take effect, no witness, whether one or more, is necessary. Even if a husband gives a divorce alone in the dark of night, the divorce still takes effect.</p><p><strong>6. Does divorce not occur if given in a state of anger?</strong></p><p>Divorce is usually given out of anger. How many people give a divorce calmly? In fact, it should be that if a marital relationship has to be severed due to a realistic and unavoidable need, then one should consult with elders, wish well for each other, and sever the marital relationship by understanding and learning the correct rulings and acting accordingly.</p><p>But alas! Most people do not even try to learn the rulings, nor do they have the good sense to consult with elders and reflect on the matter. When they face something against their will, they give a divorce in a fit of anger. And it&#039;s not just one or two; it&#039;s three divorces in one breath.</p><p>When the anger subsides, they feel remorse and start inventing different excuses. They say, &quot;I said it in a fit of rage; I didn&#039;t intend to give a divorce.&quot; These people should know that intention is not needed for a divorce to take effect. It is not an act of worship that requires intention. Whether there is intention or not, if the word &#039;divorce&#039; is uttered or written on a paper, divorce takes place. Similarly, divorce given in a state of anger also takes effect, and even if a divorce is given jokingly or in jest, it takes effect.</p><p>However, if someone becomes so extremely angry that they lose consciousness and do not remember what they said in that state, the divorce in that condition will not be effective.</p><p>The final point is that married life is a great and special blessing from Allah. It is the duty of both the husband and wife to properly value this blessing and fulfill each other&#039;s rights. It is not appropriate for a wife to ask her husband for a divorce at every turn. Similarly, it is not permissible for a husband to misuse the power given to him by Allah.</p><p>It is essential for both the husband and wife to learn all the rulings and laws of marriage, divorce, and married life. It is especially the duty of the husband never to utter the word &#039;divorce&#039; without being aware of its rulings and consequences. And if, for any reason, a divorce is given in such a way that it is no longer permissible for them to live together according to Shari&#039;ah, then they should fear Allah. They should not live together by taking refuge in various tricks, excuses, or based on false information, or by concealing the original incident. Marriage is not a matter of a moment; it is a matter for an entire lifetime.</p><p>If a divorce has truly taken place and the marital relationship has ended in the eyes of Shari&#039;ah, but they still live together as husband and wife, it will be a major sin, and they will both be involved in the sin of adultery.</p><p>May Allah protect everyone and grant them piety and purity. Amen.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al Kawsar, June 2012, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

        "data": "<p class=\"sanad\">A Serious Mistaken Practice</p><h4>Making a non-evidence into an evidence</h4><p>What the sources of Islamic law (Shari&#039;ah) are, and what rulings can be proven by which type of evidence, is a crucial subject in religion and Shari&#039;ah. Its determination has been made based on the Quran and Sunnah. Most Muslims are aware of how many and what the sources of Shari&#039;ah are. However, the people of bid&#039;ah (innovation) and batil (falsehood) always invent new types of evidence. This is so they don&#039;t have to struggle to present evidence and proof for their innovations and falsehoods. Nowadays, ignorance has spread so widely that even well-educated people are seen falling victim to astonishing misconceptions. For instance, to narrate something as a Hadith or a story of a prophet, it is considered sufficient to have merely heard it from a storyteller or found it in a book. They don&#039;t even feel the need to check whether that narration or story is in a reliable book of Hadith, if it has a chain of narration (sanad), and if the chain is authentic.</p><p>If a person cannot investigate themselves, it is still crucial to at least check if an aalim (scholar) who is considered a reliable expert in Hadith has declared it acceptable and fit for narration.</p><p>Trying to propagate something without any investigation, just because it is found in some book or pamphlet, should not be the work of a sensible and responsible person.</p><p>The rule of Shari&#039;ah is that for a narration to be acceptable, it must be recognized and respected by experts in the science of narration (Ilm al-riwayah). At a minimum, it must be narrated with an acceptable chain in a reliable book. Its popularity and prevalence among the common people have no validity. Similarly, a citation or an unverified narration from an irresponsible author or one who did not stipulate conditions for authenticity is not reliable. Most fabricated and baseless narrations are written in some book, but does that automatically make them acceptable? Na&#039;udhu Billah (We seek refuge in Allah).</p><p>It should be remembered that if an unverified narration is not only without a sanad but also munkar (objectionable), and its content has something that is objectionable from the perspective of Shari&#039;ah, or if it contains something that undermines the status and dignity of a sinless person, then it is an even more serious sin to narrate it in sermons and advice or to write it in books of practice.</p><p>In one issue of Al Kawsar, such an unsubstantiated, fabricated, and objectionable narration was called false and baseless. And because it was munkar, it was stated that it is not permissible to hold such a belief. One brother called and said, &quot;How can it be impermissible to narrate that narration or to hold that belief? So-and-so person mentioned it!&quot; But those &quot;so-and-so&quot; people were neither experts in the science of narration nor had they adopted the policy of verifying every narration and including only acceptable ones in their books.</p><p>Therefore, if a narration is written as baseless based on the citation of experts in Ilm al-riwayah, and there is no contrary decision from another expert in the same field, then it is a mistake to reject it just by saying, &quot;so-and-so person wrote it.&quot;</p><p>Hakim al-Ummat Thanwi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in &#039;At-Taqashshuf&#039;, &quot;Since those &#039;so-and-so&#039; people were not aware that this narration was baseless, they will be excused. But after the correct information from the experts is presented to you, you will no longer be excused. It is not permissible for you to follow those &#039;so-and-so&#039; people in this matter now.&quot;</p><p>We should always remember this statement of Hakim al-Ummat. The story about Prophet Zakariya (peace be upon him) that was written about in Al Kawsar is an Israelite narration. Moreover, some storytellers have added to it that—na&#039;udhu Billah—because Prophet Zakariya (peace be upon him) sought refuge in a tree instead of Allah, Allah was displeased with him. And when the saw started to cut him and he said &quot;Uhh!&quot;, Allah announced, &quot;If you say &#039;Uhh,&#039; your name will be removed from the list of prophethood!!&quot; Na&#039;udhu Billah.</p><p>This added part is not found in any Israelite narration. The question is, if it is said that it is impermissible to believe this fabricated and baseless thing, would you object to that as well?</p><p>It is regrettable that one elder wrote a letter saying, &quot;Such and such a verse in &#039;Pand Nama&#039; alludes to this incident. And the Bengali translator has mentioned that incident in its annotation.&quot;</p><p>It is a pity that he has made the allusion in Pand Nama a standard for determining authenticity. However, it is not necessary that he or the translator correctly understood the poet&#039;s allusion. Who does not know that while one can take advice from the books of Attar (may Allah have mercy on him), a narration cannot be called authentic just because it is mentioned in his book? To determine its authenticity, one must inquire with the scholars of Hadith and act accordingly. In this context, the warning of Hakim al-Ummat Thanwi (may Allah have mercy on him), mentioned in the book &#039;Ta&#039;limuddin,&#039; should be heeded with great importance.</p><p>If we do not act according to this guidance, what will be the difference between us and the people of bid&#039;ah?</p><p>This statement of Shaykhul Islam Hazrat Madani (may Allah have mercy on him) is also worthy of being written in golden letters. In a long letter, he wrote, &quot;In matters of rulings, reverence should not be given a place. One should thoroughly verify and investigate.&quot;</p><p>May Allah grant us the ability to follow in the footsteps of our pious predecessors, who were guided, followers of the Sunnah, and lovers of investigation.</p><p><strong><em>Abu Abdur Rashid Muhammad Abdul Malek</em></strong></p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al Kawsar, July-August 2012, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

I have seen in villages and some people have also called and informed me that it is a common practice, especially among women, to make sure to inform the mosque&#039;s Imam after they have completed a recitation of the Quran during Ramadan, saying, &quot;So-and-so has completed a recitation, please &#039;gift&#039; it (bakhshana)!&quot; In some places, there is also a practice of sending some hadiya (gift) along with this message.</p><p>There are many aspects of this practice that are objectionable. For example:</p><ul><li><p>a. Reciting the Quran is a self-sufficient act of worship. It is not necessary, nor is there any rule, that if someone completes a recitation, it must be &#039;gifted.&#039; Yes, if someone wants to convey the reward of a good deed to a deceased Muslim, they are allowed to do so. However, this is neither restricted to reciting the Quran nor limited to the month of Ramadan. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to give a permissible act the same importance as an obligatory one.</p></li><li><p>b. For conveying the reward, the intention before or after the act is sufficient. For example, intending that the act is being done on behalf of so-and-so. Similarly, a heartfelt prayer is sufficient, such as &quot;O Allah! Grant the reward of this act to so-and-so, or to all deceased Muslims.&quot; This is enough for conveying the reward. There is no need to &#039;gift&#039; it through an Imam or any revered elder. The notion that the reward will not reach the deceased without being &#039;gifted&#039; by an elder is a mistaken belief that must be abandoned.</p></li><li><p>c. The practice of giving or taking hadiya for &#039;gifting&#039; is also objectionable. &#039;Gifting&#039; an act means to pray for its reward to be conveyed. Prayer (du&#039;a) is a pure act of worship, and it is not permissible to exchange hadiya for it.</p></li></ul><p>Furthermore, this practice of having the Imam &#039;gift&#039; the act can reveal a woman&#039;s name, the fact that she completed a recitation, or the number of recitations she did, which are private matters. What is the justification for doing this without any need? Thus, in all respects, this custom is objectionable.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al Kawsar, September 2012, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

This is also inappropriate because a phone could ring in an impure place, such as a toilet, causing the holy words of Allah to be heard in a place where they should not be.</p><p>The author concludes by praying that Allah grants everyone a correct understanding of the religion.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, January 2013, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

People often play Quranic recitation in the background while they work, not to listen to it with attention, but simply as a habit of having something to listen to. This practice is incorrect because listening to the Quran is a distinct act of worship that requires full concentration.</p><p>The author cites a verse from the Quran (Surah Al-Araf, 204), which states, &quot;And when the Quran is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy.&quot; Ignoring this command by not listening attentively and engaging in other activities is a violation of this divine order.</p><h5>The Example of the Prophet (PBUH)</h5><p>The text provides an example from the Sunnah to highlight the importance of attentive listening. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself enjoyed listening to the Quran from others. He once asked Abdullah ibn Mas&#039;ud (RA) to recite for him, and when a specific verse was recited, the Prophet (PBUH) was so moved that he began to weep. This shows that the proper way to engage with the Quran is with full focus and respect.</p><p>The author concludes by saying that if a person needs to listen to something while working, they should choose something else, such as Islamic hymns (ghazal), rather than using the Quran as a background sound.</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al-Kawthar, February 2013, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

Though Allah initially refused, He eventually granted permission for one day. Sulaiman (AS) then ordered the jinn and humans to gather all the food and halal animals on Earth. They cooked the food and spread it across a vast field that took two months to travel. A gigantic sea creature then emerged and ate all the food by itself, after which it asked for more. The creature said that Allah provides it three times that amount every day. Overwhelmed, Sulaiman (AS) fell into prostration.</p><h5>Why It Is Baseless</h5><p>The author provides several reasons why this story is a fabrication:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Inappropriate for a Prophet:</strong> A prophet of Allah would not make such a bizarre and illogical request, as it suggests a lack of understanding about Allah&#039;s creation. Such a notion is unbecoming of a prophet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contradicts Logic: </strong>It&#039;s illogical for a prophet to insist on such a request after being denied by Allah, and it&#039;s equally improbable for Allah to permit such an absurd undertaking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Violates Natural Laws: </strong>The story suggests that all creatures, including sea animals, would eat cooked food, which is not true.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unbelievable Details: </strong>The claim that a single fish could eat a two-month-long stretch of food in an instant is impossible and defies all logic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lacks Basic Knowledge:</strong> The idea that cooked food can be preserved from spoilage simply by air flow is scientifically incorrect.</p></li></ul><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The author warns against spreading or believing such baseless and illogical stories.

However, He has not made any month, day, night, or time inauspicious or unlucky. Time itself is a blessing (Ni&#039;mat) and mercy from Allah.

Furthermore, Muharram is one of the four highly important &#039;Sacred Months&#039; (Ashhur-e-Hurum). Its importance and virtue are the greatest after the month of Ramadan. How can this month become inauspicious because of the martyrdom of Hussain (R.A.)? The misfortune and evil lie with the bad deeds of those people who wrongfully martyred him.

He even donated the clothes on his body. To cover his private parts (Satr), he then wore a sackcloth (chat). Allah was so pleased with this act of Uthman that He called all the angels and said, &#039;My Beloved&#039;s friend Uthman has donated everything he possessed and has worn a sackcloth. Therefore, you should also wear a sackcloth in imitation of him.&#039; All the angels then wore sackcloth for three long days.&quot;</p><p>Many people narrate this story to illustrate the virtue of donating in the path of Allah or the virtues of Uthman (R.A.).

I have never seen you in such clothing?&#039; Jibreel replied, &#039;Allah Almighty has commanded all the angels in the heavens to wear this garment, because Abu Bakr wore this garment on Earth.&#039;&quot;</p><p>This is the forged narration. However, storytellers often add more details before and after it to make it more sensational. The virtues of Abu Bakr (R.A.) and his acts of charity are narrated in authentic Hadiths. Those are what should be narrated.</p><p>A Hadith states that Umar (R.A.) said: Once, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) ordered us to give charity. I had some wealth in my hand at the time. I thought to myself, &#039;Today I will surpass Abu Bakr.&#039; I presented half of my wealth to the Prophet. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked, &quot;What have you left for your family (O Umar!)?&quot; I replied, &quot;A similar half.&quot;</p><p>Then, Abu Bakr brought all of his wealth. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked, &quot;O Abu Bakr! What have you left for your family?&quot; He replied, &quot;I have left Allah and His Messenger.&quot; At that, I said, &quot;By Allah, I can never surpass him.&quot; (Jami&#039; Tirmidhi, Hadith: 3675; Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith: 1680; Mustadrak al-Hakim, Hadith: 1510)</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al Kawsar, January 2014, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

It is narrated by Habib ibn Abi Habib, and he used to forge Hadiths.&quot; (Al-Manar al-Munif 1:47, Narration No. 44). Hafiz Suyuti (R.A.) and Allamah Ibn &#039;Arraq (R.A.) agreed with this conclusion. Allamah &#039;Abdul Hayy Lakhnavi (R.A.), when discussing fabricated narrations regarding the virtue of the Ashura fast, began his discussion with this very narration.

Therefore, only the virtue narrated in the authentic Hadith should be mentioned.</p><p>There are many other baseless narrations and incidents related to Ashura prevalent in our society.

However, this statement has not even the remotest connection to the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p><p>This is a baseless statement whose fabrication is beyond any doubt.

It is claimed that to show sympathy for that event, Halwa and Ruti are elaborately eaten on this day. However, the Battle of Uhud did not happen on the 15th of Sha&#039;ban; it happened on the 7th of Shawwal. Therefore, if there were any connection to that event, it would be on the 7th of Shawwal, not the 15th of Sha&#039;ban.</p><p>The virtue of the fifteenth night of Sha&#039;ban (Shab-e-Barat) is proven by authentic (Sahih) Hadith. (For details on the virtues of this night, see the Al Kawsar issue of September 2005 under the title &quot;Sha&#039;ban and Shab-e-Barat in the Grip of Extremism and Negligence&quot;). It is narrated in the Hadith that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: &quot;Allah looks at His creation (with mercy) on the night of the middle of Sha&#039;ban (the night between the 14th and 15th of Sha&#039;ban) and forgives everyone except a polytheist (Mushrik) and one who harbors malice (Bid&#039;ah).&quot; (Sahih Ibn Hibban, Hadith 5665; Shu&#039;ab al-Iman, Bayhaqi, Hadith 3833). But what is the connection between this night and Halwa-Ruti?</p><p>One should restrict oneself only to the virtues that have been proven for this night. It is not right to fall for customs and traditions (Rasm-Rewaz) and thereby be deprived of its actual virtue.</p><p>The matter under discussion is one of the various customs associated with this night and has no basis whatsoever. It is necessary to refrain from such acts and all other customs and traditions centered around this night.</p><p>And stating such a baseless claim as a Hadith of the Messenger is a very severe sin. May Allah protect us and grant us the ability to adhere to the authentic word and deed in all matters of the Deen (religion).</p><p class=\"reference\">Source: Monthly Al Kawsar, August 2014, <a href=\"http://www.alkawsar.com\">www.alkawsar.com</a></p>"

There is no doubt that people express such views due to their neglect and ignorance in matters of Deen (religion).

The incident is recounted as follows: When the Prophet (ﷺ)&#039;s sacred tooth was broken (shaheed) during the Battle of Uhud, Uways al-Qarani learned of the matter and was extremely distressed. He had immense love for the Prophet (ﷺ). Upon hearing the news, he could not remain calm. He thought, &quot;What good is this tooth of mine when the Prophet&#039;s sacred tooth has been broken?&quot; He broke one of his own teeth. Then, he reconsidered, &quot;Perhaps the tooth I broke is not the same one the Prophet (ﷺ)&#039;s was, maybe it was a different tooth.&quot; Thinking this, he broke another one of his teeth. In this manner, he broke all of his own teeth.</p><p>Various people recount this story in different ways as the ultimate example of a follower&#039;s love for the Prophet. However, this story has no basis whatsoever. Mullah Ali Qari (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that this incident is not authenticated. (See: Al-Madin al-Adani, Al-Burhan al-Jali fi Tahqiq Intisab al-Sufiyyat ila Ali, pp. 164-165).</p><p>Uways al-Qarani was a great Tabi&#039;i (successor to the Companions) and a pious person (Buzurg). He was a resident of Yemen and passed away in 37 AH. Although he lived during the time of the Prophet (ﷺ), he did not get the opportunity to meet him. Yet, he had immense love for the Prophet (ﷺ). He had an elderly mother and always treated her kindly and served her. The Prophet (ﷺ) knew him.</p><p>It is narrated in a Hadith that Umar (R.A.) said, <strong><em>&quot;The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, &#039;A man named Uways will come to you from Yemen. He has no one in Yemen except his mother. He suffered from leucoderma (vitiligo). He prayed to Allah, and Allah cured his disease, but a spot the size of a dinar or a dirham remained white on his body. If any of you meet him, let him ask him to seek forgiveness (Istighfar) for you.&#039;&quot;</em></strong> (Sahih Muslim, Hadith 2542)</p><p>The incident of the Companions meeting Uways al-Qarani is also narrated in the Hadith. However, nowhere is there any mention of such a tale. It is mentioned in Sahih Muslim that when Umar (R.A.) met Uways al-Qarani, he asked him about all the signs the Prophet (ﷺ) had mentioned to identify him. In this narration, Umar (R.A.), following the Prophet&#039;s instructions, asked him to seek forgiveness for him, and Uways al-Qarani prayed for Umar (R.A.). The following year during the Hajj season, a person from the area where Uways al-Qarani lived came, and Umar (R.A.) inquired about him.

Capitalizing on this, a class of storytellers narrate many strange and baseless incidents in society under the title &#039;Dialogue Between Moses (A.S.) and Allah,&#039; which may heat up the lecture halls but have no foundation.</p><p>One of the famous dialogues among these is about the blessing of health:</p><blockquote><p>Moses (A.S.) asked Allah, &quot;O Allah! If You were Moses and I were Allah, what would You ask for?&quot; Allah said, &quot;That is not My Majesty.&quot; Moses insisted, &quot;I know, but if it were so, what would You ask for?&quot; Then Allah is claimed to have said, &quot;I would ask for health.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>This fabricated tale is narrated to explain how great a blessing health is, but it has no connection whatsoever with Moses (A.S.).</p><p>The implication of such a dialogue is that Moses (A.S.) was mocking Allah (Na&#039;uzubillah - May Allah protect us from such a thought), which is never appropriate for a Prophet. To attribute such a statement to a Prophet is an act of great disrespect and a reprehensible sin, which must be avoided.</p><p>One should rather quote the beautiful sayings about the blessing of health that have come down in the authentic Hadith.</p><p>The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:</p><p class=\"hadith\">نِعْمَتَانِ مَغْبُونٌ فِيهِمَا كَثِيرٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ: الصِّحَّةُ وَالْفَرَاغُ</p><blockquote><p>&quot;There are two blessings in which many people are deceived (or suffer loss): Health and Free Time.&quot; (Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 6412)</p></blockquote><p>People do not utilize health and free time appropriately.

The Hadith draws attention to this very point.</p><p>Therefore, saying baseless things when authentic narrations exist is nothing but ignorance.

Her biography is recorded in various biographical works, including Siyar A&#039;lam al-Nubala&#039; by Imam Dhahabi, Wafayat al-A&#039;yan by Ibn Khallikan, and At-Tabaqat al-Kubra by Sha&#039;rani. However, many fabricated tales and narratives about her are prevalent in society.</p><p>One story frequently heard about her and the famous Tabi&#039;i (successor to the Companions) Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on them both) is as follows:</p><p>Once, Hasan al-Basri (R.A.) spread his prayer mat and prayed upon water. When Rabi&#039;ah al-Basriyyah learned of this, she spread her prayer mat and prayed upon air (in the open space). When Hasan al-Basri (R.A.) came to know this, he said, &quot;Rabi&#039;ah&#039;s status (Maqam) is far above mine.&quot;</p><p>This tale is completely baseless. It is an entirely fictional story that has no connection to reality. This incident is not mentioned in any reliable history book or any authentic biographical work written about Rabi&#039;ah al-Basriyyah.</p><p>Such stories are concocted merely to illustrate how great saints (Buzurg) they were.</p><p>It is an acknowledged fact that they were great figures. They were foremost in asceticism (Zuhd), piety (Taqwa), detachment from the world, and fear of God. But why is there a need to prove their sainthood with such tales? And what connection do these things have with true sainthood anyway?</p><p>It is acknowledged that different miraculous occurrences (Karamat) appear from the friends of Allah (Awliya&#039;) at various times. At the same time, it is also acknowledged that Karamat has no relation to sainthood. The measure of sainthood and being beloved by Allah is piety (Taqwa)—that is, the fear of Allah and living life according to the Sunnah.</p><p>Furthermore, another aspect of this fabricated story is visible: one person prays on a mat over water, and upon hearing this, the other prays on a mat over air—as if a competition of sainthood is going on! The people of Allah seek to conceal themselves. But this story depicts respected saints like them as showcasing their spiritual status. Na&#039;uzubillah (May Allah protect us from such a thought). This is a great slander against them!</p><p>Another point is that Hasan al-Basri (R.A.) passed away in 110 AH. Rabi&#039;ah al-Basriyyah was born in 99 or 100 AH. This means that at the time of Hasan al-Basri&#039;s death, Rabi&#039;ah al-Basriyyah (R.A.) was at most 10 or 11 years old. In Siyar A&#039;lam al-Nubala&#039; (8/241), Dhahabi (R.A.) states that Rabi&#039;ah al-Basriyyah died in 180 AH and is reputed to have lived for eighty years.

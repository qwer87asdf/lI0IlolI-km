    "data": "1. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: When the month of Ramadan arrives, the gates of heaven are opened, the gates of Hellfire are closed, and the devils are chained. (Bukhari, Muslim)<br><br>2. Hazrat Sahl ibn Sa’d (RA) narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said: Paradise has eight gates, one of which is called Rayyan. None will enter through it except those who fast. (Bukhari, Muslim)<br><br>3. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said: Whoever fasts during Ramadan with faith and seeking its reward, all their past sins will be forgiven. Whoever prays at night during Ramadan with faith and seeking its reward, all their past sins will be forgiven. Whoever spends the Night of Qadr in worship with faith and seeking its reward, all their past sins will be forgiven. (Bukhari, Muslim)<br><br>4. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Allah Almighty says, ‘Every action of the son of Adam is for him except fasting; it is for Me, and I shall reward it.’ Fasting is a shield (against Hellfire). When one of you is fasting, they should avoid obscene speech and quarrels. If someone insults or fights with them, they should say, ‘I am fasting.’ By the One in whose Hand is Muhammad’s life, the smell of a fasting person’s mouth is sweeter to Allah than the fragrance of musk. A fasting person has two moments of joy: one when they break their fast, and another when they meet their Lord and receive the reward for their fast. (Bukhari)<br><br>5. Hazrat Abdullah ibn Amr (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Fasting and the Quran will intercede for a servant on the Day of Judgment. Fasting will say, ‘O Lord, I prevented him from food and desires during the day, so accept my intercession for him.’ The Quran will say, ‘I prevented him from sleeping at night, so accept my intercession for him.’ Thus, both intercessions will be accepted (and he will be admitted to Paradise). (Bayhaqi)<br><br>6. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: When the first night of Ramadan arrives, the devils and rebellious jinn are chained, the gates of Hellfire are closed and none are opened, the gates of Paradise are opened and none are closed. A caller calls out, ‘O seeker of good, come forward! O seeker of evil, desist!’ Allah frees many people from Hellfire during this month, and this happens every night. (Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah)<br><br>7. Hazrat Ibn Abbas (RA) narrated that when Ramadan arrived, the Messenger of Allah (SAW) would free all prisoners and give to every beggar. It is also reported in the books of Hadith that the Prophet (SAW) said: If someone does not abandon lying and evil deeds while fasting, Allah has no need for them to abandon food and drink. (Bukhari)<br><br>8. Hazrat Salman Farsi (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) delivered a sermon on the last day of Sha’ban, saying: O people! A great and blessed month has approached you, a month containing a night better than a thousand months. Allah has made its fasting obligatory and its night prayers voluntary. Whoever performs a voluntary good deed in this month is like one who performs an obligatory deed in other months. Whoever performs an obligatory deed in this month is like one who performs seventy obligatory deeds in other months. It is a month of patience, and the reward for patience is Paradise. It is a month of sympathy, a month in which a believer’s sustenance is increased. Whoever provides Iftar to a fasting person will have their sins forgiven and be saved from Hellfire, and they will receive the same reward as the fasting person without diminishing their reward. The Companions said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, not everyone has the means to provide a full Iftar.’ He replied, ‘Allah grants this reward to whoever provides Iftar with a sip of milk, a date, or a sip of water. Whoever satisfies a fasting person’s hunger, Allah will let them drink from my Hawd (Pool of Kawthar), after which they will not thirst until they enter Paradise. This is a month whose beginning is mercy, middle is forgiveness, and end is freedom from Hellfire. Whoever lightens the burden of their servants in this month, Allah will forgive them and free them from Hellfire.’ (Bayhaqi)<br><br>9. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said: Many fasting people gain nothing from their fast except hunger, and many who pray at night gain nothing except sleeplessness (if their deeds lack sincerity and are for show). (Ibn Majah, Nasai)<br><br>10. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said: Whoever intentionally breaks a Ramadan fast without a valid Sharia reason, even fasting for a lifetime outside Ramadan will not compensate for it. (Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood)<br><br>11. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: The prayers of three people are not rejected: a fasting person until they break their fast, a just ruler, and an oppressed person. Allah raises their prayers above the clouds, opens the gates of heaven for them, and says, ‘By My Majesty, I will surely help you, even if it is delayed.’ (Musnad Ahmad Hadith: 9743, Jami Tirmidhi Hadith: 3428, Ibn Majah Hadith: 1752)<br><br>12. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: By Allah, no month is better for Muslims than Ramadan, and no month is worse for hypocrites than Ramadan. For believers gather strength and provisions for worship in this month, while hypocrites seek out people’s faults and negligence. It is a month of gain for the believer and loss for the hypocrite. (Musnad Ahmad Hadith: 8368, Musannaf Ibn Abi Shayba Hadith: 8968, Sahih Ibn Khuzaima Hadith: 1884, Tabarani Hadith: 9004, Bayhaqi Shu’ab al-Iman Hadith: 3335)<br><br>13. Hazrat Abdullah ibn Amr (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Fasting and the Quran will intercede for a servant on the Day of Judgment. Fasting will say, ‘I prevented him from food and desires during the day, so accept my intercession for him.’ The Quran will say, ‘I kept him from sleeping at night, so accept my intercession for him.’ Thus, both intercessions will be accepted. (Musnad Ahmad Hadith: 6589, Tabarani, Majma’uz Zawaaid 3/419)<br><br>14. I’tikaf is a Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) and Jibril (AS). Every Ramadan, Jibril (AS) would recite the Quran to the Prophet (SAW), and the Prophet would recite it back. In the year of his passing, the Prophet (SAW) recited and listened to the Quran twice. (Bukhari, Muslim)<br><br>15. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) was the most generous, but he was even more generous when Jibril (AS) met him to recite the Quran. Jibril (AS) would meet him every night in Ramadan to teach him the Quran. When Jibril (AS) met him, the Prophet (SAW) was more generous in spending wealth than a swift wind. (Bukhari, Muslim)<br><br>16. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) never neglected I’tikaf. He would perform I’tikaf for ten days every year. In the year of his passing, he performed I’tikaf for twenty days. When his wives began competing to perform I’tikaf, he stopped and made up for it in the first ten days of Shawwal. (Bukhari)"

    "data": "1. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) once asked: If there were a flowing river by someone’s door and they bathed in it five times daily, would any dirt remain on them? They replied, ‘No dirt would remain.’ He said, ‘That is the example of the five daily prayers; through them, Allah wipes away sins.’ (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 324)<br><br>2. Jarir ibn Abdullah (RA) narrated that while we were with the Prophet (SAW), he looked at the full moon and said to the Companions: In Paradise, you will see Allah clearly, just as you see this full moon without any difficulty or commotion. But to attain this blessing, you must be diligent about the prayers before sunrise (Fajr) and before sunset (Asr). (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 340)<br><br>3. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Whoever catches one rak’ah of Asr prayer before sunset has completed the Asr prayer, and whoever catches one rak’ah of Fajr prayer before sunrise has completed the Fajr prayer. (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 342)<br><br>4. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Do not rush to prayer upon hearing the Iqamah; come to prayer with calm, order, and dignity. Pray whatever you catch with the Imam, and complete what you miss afterward. (However, one should arrive at the congregation before the Iqamah.) (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 388)<br><br>5. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) swore: I wish to appoint someone to lead the prayer after the Adhan and then search for those who did not join the congregation, have firewood brought, and set fire to their homes while they are inside. He expressed his displeasure, saying: By Allah, many people still do not come to the mosque for Isha prayer even if they hope for a small sweet, yet they are not as drawn to the congregation. (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 391)<br><br>6. Hazrat Abdullah (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Prayer in congregation is twenty-seven times more rewarding than praying alone. (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 392)<br><br>7. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Praying in congregation at the mosque is twenty-five times more rewarding than praying at home or in the market. When a person performs Wudu perfectly and goes to the mosque solely for prayer, each step they take erases a sin and elevates their rank. After praying, as long as they remain in the prayer place, angels pray for them, saying, ‘O Allah, forgive their sins, O Allah, shower mercy upon them.’ The entire time they wait for the next prayer, with only prayer keeping them from returning home, is counted as time spent in prayer. (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 393)<br><br>8. Hazrat Abu Huraira (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Does the one who raises their head before the Imam during Ruku or Sujood not fear that Allah may transform their head or form into that of a donkey? (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 413)<br><br>9. ‘The difference between a believer and disbelief or polytheism is abandoning prayer.’ (Muslim)<br><br>10. Surely, when a person prays, they converse privately with their Lord. Prayer is a symbol of love between a servant and their Lord and gratitude for His blessings. One proof of the importance of prayer is that it was the first act of worship made obligatory upon the Prophet (SAW) and was decreed in the heavens during the Night of Mi’raj for the Muslim Ummah. Additionally, when asked, ‘Which deed is the best?’ the Prophet (SAW) replied, ‘Praying on time.’ (Bukhari, Muslim)"

    "data": "1. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Charity does not decrease wealth, and Allah increases a servant’s honor through forgiveness. Whoever humbles themselves for Allah’s sake, Allah elevates their status. (Muslim Sharif, Hadith No. 4689)<br><br>2. Hazrat Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Only two people are worthy of envy: one whom Allah has given wealth and appointed to spend it in righteous causes, and one whom Allah has given wisdom (knowledge of the Quran and Hadith) and who judges by it and teaches others. (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 71)<br><br>3. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Every morning, two angels descend from the heavens. One says, ‘O Allah, grant reward to the giver,’ and the other says, ‘O Allah, bring ruin to the miser.’ It is also narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Allah says, ‘O son of Adam, give, and I will give to you.’ (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 1351, 4933)<br><br>4. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: If someone gives charity equivalent to a date from lawful earnings—and Allah accepts only what is lawful—Allah accepts that charity and increases it, just as one of you nurtures a foal until it grows large. Likewise, Allah multiplies the charity until it becomes like a mountain. (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 1321)<br><br>5. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Prayer, fasting, charity, enjoining good, and forbidding evil wipe out sins related to a person’s family, wealth, children, and neighbors. (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 1345)<br><br>6. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: A generous person is close to Allah, Paradise, and people, but far from Hellfire. A miser is far from Allah, Paradise, and people, but close to Hellfire. Indeed, an ignorant generous person is dearer to Allah than a miserly worshipper. (Tirmidhi Sharif, Hadith No. 1884)<br><br>7. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: For one whom Allah has given wealth but does not pay its Zakat, on the Day of Judgment, their wealth will be transformed into a bald, venomous snake with two black spots above its eyes. It will be wrapped around their neck like a collar, biting their cheeks, saying, ‘I am your wealth! I am your hoarded treasure!’ (Bukhari Sharif, Hadith No. 1315)"

The Prophet (SAW) himself would pay it one or two days before Eid.’ (Abu Dawood)<br><br>3. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) prescribed Sadaqat al-Fitr to purify the fast from vain talk and misdeeds and to provide food for the needy. Whoever pays it before the Eid prayer, it is accepted as Zakat; whoever pays it after the prayer, it is considered as regular charity. (Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah)<br><br>4. Abdullah ibn Sa’labah (RA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: Pay one Sa’ (of food) for every person, whether male or female, young or old, free or slave. If they are wealthy, Allah will purify them, and if they are poor, Allah will give them more than what they gave. (Bayhaqi, Volume 4, pp. 164-165)<br><br>5. The Messenger (SAW) said: Make the poor free from want on this day (Eid). (Bayhaqi)<br><br>6. The Prophet (SAW) said: The Zakat of Fitr purifies the fasting person from idle or obscene talk and satisfies the hunger of the poor. (Abu Dawood, Hadith No. 1609)"
